## Introduction

Advanced Locomotion System (ALS) provides a nice Overlay System that allows us to alter the entire locomotion animation just by applying simple overlay poses. 
This project integrates the ALS Overlay Layering System into the new Unreal Engine Motion Matching Game Animation Sample.

## Features

- Game Animation Sample
- Overlay layering system built with separate Anim Graphs and Linked Layers
- All overlays from ALS
- Basic weapon attach system from ALS
- Basic overlay switcher widget from ALS
- Removed Echo and Twinblast characters and Manny/Quinn 4k textures to lower project size

## Overview

An overview of the system is available on my YouTube channel [Polygon Hive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDWNfIqvWBk&list=PLs9e0eJQMI2aaulgKJzC8feN1UEwDkEnq)
